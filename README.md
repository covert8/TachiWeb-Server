# TachiWeb-Server
TachiWeb-Server is an attempt to port [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi) to the desktop and server platforms.

# About
TachiWeb-Server provides a consistent and flexible API for programs using the Tachiyomi backend.
TachiWeb-Server allows multiple programs to use the same Tachiyomi library at the same time and provides a foundation for alternative frontends to build on.

Currently, this project comes bundled with a built in HTML/CSS/JS frontend that is enabled by default.

TachiWeb is not officially supported by Tachiyomi or it's contributors.

# Live demo
~A live demo is available here: [http://d3.nulldev.xyz:4567/](http://d3.nulldev.xyz:4567/)~ Currently not working. Will be fixed soon!
**NOTE**: Batoto normally requires log in but in the demo, I will use my own credentials.
Please don't destroy the live demo.

# Motivation
There is currently no Manga reader that can be easily synced between the desktop and mobile.
TachiWeb-Server is fully compatible with Tachiyomi's data structures and backups, allowing easy migration between the two.
**Seamless sync between the two programs is a goal and planned feature.**

# Installation

## Local installation
Refer to [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/TachiWeb/TachiWeb-Server/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

# State
TachiWeb-Server usable, but still **alpha** software.
The API is not stable and can change at any time.
